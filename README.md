Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of "Historical Sales and Active Inventory"

EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is the brainstorming stage of Machine Learning. It is a very important step which takes place after feature engineering and acquiring data and it should be done before any modeling. It's very important for a data scientist to be able to understand the nature of the data without making assumptions.
The purpose of EDA is to use summary statistics and visualizations to better understand data, and find clues about the tendencies (the patterns and trends in the data) of the data, its quality and to formulate assumptions and the hypothesis of our analysis. At this stage, all the useful insights are drawn and correlations between the variables are understood.
EDA or Exploratory Data Analysis is an approach for summarizing, visualizing, and becoming intimately familiar with the important characteristics of a data set.

The main objective is to cover how to:
1. Read and examine a dataset and classify variables by their type: Quantitative vs. Categorical
2. Handle categorical variables with numerically coded values
3. Perform univariate and bivariate analysis and derive meaningful insights about the dataset
4. Identify and treat missing values and remove dataset outliers
5. Build a correlation matrix to identify relevant variables
